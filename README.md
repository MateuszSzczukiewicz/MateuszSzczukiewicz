# Mateusz Szczukiewicz
Software Engineer – Systems, Performance, and Embedded

I build reliable, high-performance software, from embedded C++ for satellite systems to efficient, minimal-overhead web runtimes. My work balances full-stack engineering at a high-growth startup with a deep focus on systems-level programming and architecture.

---

### Current Engineering Focus

* **Satellite Systems (PWSat-3):** Developing real-time, fault-tolerant C++ code (FreeRTOS) for the satellite's **On-Board Computer (OBC)**. My work focuses on command handling, data acquisition, and implementing communication protocols for the primary **UHF radio transceiver**.
* **Full-Stack & Systems (Spinetime)**: As a core engineer, I build and maintain systems across the entire stack: frontend (**Nuxt**), backend (**Django, FastAPI**), DevOps, and medical algorithms.

### Technical Stack & Interests

* **Languages:** C, C++, Go, TypeScript, Python, OCaml
* **Domains:** Embedded Systems (RTOS), Low-Level Networking (TCP/IP), Systems Architecture (IoT & Resource-Constrained Devices), API Design.
* **Technologies:** Next.js, Nest, Vue.js, React.js, Django, FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, Bun, Docker.
* **Environment & Tooling:** Deep interest in the Linux ecosystem (NixOS, Arch), tiling window managers(i3wm, hyprland), terminal-based tools (Neovim, TMUX), and shell scripting.

### Engineering Practice & Study

I maintain a disciplined approach to growth through daily problem-solving (Exercism, LeetCode) and continuous study of technical literature.

* **Actively Exploring:** **Rust**, **Zig** and **OCaml** for high-performance systems programming.
* **Actively Studying:** Electronics and hardware design to deepen my understanding of fault-tolerant systems and the interface between software and bare metal.
